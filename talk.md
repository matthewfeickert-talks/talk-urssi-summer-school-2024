# Hypothetical workflow for the typical scientist

<!-- TODO: Spread this out across multiple slides with images -->

.huge[
1. Work on idea for paper with collaborators
2. Do exploratory analysis in scripts and Jupyter ecosystem
3. As research progresses need to write more complicated functions and workflows
4. Code begins to sprawl across multiple directories
5. Software dependencies begin to become more complicated
6. The code "works on my machine", but what about your collaborators?

# Going further: Distributing packages

.huge[

]

.tiny[
(tiny font sorry)
```
# General pattern is:
# python -m pip install "project @ git+https://example.com/repo/project.git@branch#subdirectory=path"
$ python -m pip install \
  "git+https://github.com/matthewfeickert-talks/talk-urssi-summer-school-2024.git#subdirectory=examples/simple_packaging"
```
]

(more reasonable font size, and more common, example)

```
# Works for pure-Python packages
$ python -m pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf.git"
# as well as packages with compiled extensions
$ python -m pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit.git"
```

---
# Going further: Distributing packages

.huge[
Ideally we'd prefer a more organized approach: distribution through a .bold[package index]

First we need to create .bold[distributions] of our packaged code.

Distributions that `pip` can install:

* .bold[[source distribution (sdist)](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist)]: A tarfile (`.tar.gz`) of the source files of our package (subset of all the files in the repository)
* .bold[[wheel](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Built-Distribution)]: A zipfile (`.whl`) of the file system structure and package metadata with any dependencies prebuilt
   - No arbitrary code execution, only decompressing and copying of files
]

---
# Going further: Distributing packages

.huge[
To create these .bold[distributions] from source code, rely on our package .bold[build backend] (e.g. [`hatchling`](https://hatch.pypa.io/)) and .bold[build frontend] tool like [`build`](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
]

```
$ python -m pip install --upgrade build
$ python -m build .

# Going further: Distributing packages

.huge[
Can now [securely upload](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-04-20-introducing-trusted-publishers/) the distributions under `./dist/` to [.italic[any] package index](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/hosting-your-own-index/) that understands how to use them.

The most common is the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) which serves as the default package index for `pip`.

# Distributing packages: [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/)

.huge[
The `conda` family of package managers ([`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/), [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/), [`micromamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html), [`pixi`](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/overview)) take an alternative approach from `pip`.

Instead of installing Python packages, they act as general purpose package managers and install .bold[all dependencies] (including Python) as OS and architecture specific .bold[built binaries] (`.conda` files &mdash; `zip`file containing compressed `tar` files) hosted on conda-forge.

Allows an additional level of runtime environment specification not possible with just `pip`, though getting environment solves right can become more complicated.
]

---
# Distributing packages: [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/)

.huge[
Popular in scientific computing as arbitrary binaries can be hosted, including compilers (e.g. `gcc`, Fortran) and even the [full NVIDIA CUDA stack](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1697435241152127369)!

With the change to full binaries only this also requires that specification of the environment being installed is important.

With sdists and wheels, if there is no compatible wheel available, `pip` will automatically .bold[fall back] to trying to locally build from the sidst. Can't do that if there is .bold[no matching `.conda` binary]!
]

---
# Defining the environment: [Application vs. Library](https://iscinumpy.dev/post/app-vs-library/)

.huge[
Have been reasonably assuming that packaged code can be used in arbitrary environments with other code that is compatible (library-like).

For distributing code, this is probably the correct view, but your analysis is not a library. Your analysis is an application (a hand crafted implementation of code from libraries).

While your analysis might run with arbitrary configurations of the defined libraries and runtimes (.bold[reusable]) want to also have a hash-level specified version for .bold[reproduciblity]: a .bold[lock file]
]

---
# Defining the environment: Lock file

.huge[
Lock files are simple: A hash level record of every dependency in the environment.

Allow for reproducibility by simply being an list of every file to download from the internet.

Should be programmatically generated from a high level requirements file and maintained in version control with your analysis.

* For `pip`: [`pip-tools`](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [`pdm`](https://pdm.fming.dev/), [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/), [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/)
* For `conda` family: [`conda-lock`](https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/), [`pixi`](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/)
]

---
# Defining the environment: Comparing to Julia

.huge[
The approach of [`pixi`](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/) is [similar to Julia](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/toml-files/).

* `Project.toml`: .bold[describes the project on a high level]
* `Manifest.toml`: .bold[absolute record] of the state of the packages in the environment (a lock file)

Julia's package manager [`Pkg.jl`](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/) provides users a high level interface to edit `Project.toml` and then automatically updates `Manifest.toml` in response. Reproducibility of environment by default!

* Library: `Project.toml` in version control
* Application: `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` in version control
]

# Areas still to discuss another time

.huge[
* Full environment specification with Linux (Open Container Initiative (OCI)) container images (Docker, Apptainer, Podman)
* Orchestration of multiple environments inside of an analysis
   - Using workflow languages
* The difficult realities of long term preservation
   - Assumptions of present technologies don't translate forever into the future, infrastructure goes away

# Recommendations: Tooling

.huge[
Don't start your next Python project from scratch! Use the Scientific Python library development Cookiecutter: [`cookie`](https://github.com/scientific-python/cookie)

```
$ pipx install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter gh:scientific-python/cookie
#  [1/14] The name of your project (package):
# ...
```

`cookie` will setup your repository for you with templated layouts for 11 different build backends and adheres to packaging and development best practices.
]

# Recommendations: Community Guides

.huge[
Packaging standards and best practices continue to change and get better. Instead of trying to maintain your own resources .bold[follow and engage] with community resources created by the teams that are building the tools and infrastructure.

# Zenodo: DOI minting made easy

- Everything on Zenodo has a DOI
   - Provides both a .bold[project] DOI (resolves to latest) and .bold[version specific] DOI
- Enable it to [automatically preserve work from GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) (can also directly upload, but lose out on automation)
   - Benefit from having a DOI for .bold[every version] regardless of software paper landscape state
- Once you have a DOI, put it .bold[everywhere] (again)
   - Recommend sharing the project DOI and letting users select a specific version if they want it
